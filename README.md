# Create-Cartoon

image processing, computer vision, OpenCV

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to create cartoon effect and sketches of a given image. 

## Program

The programs are written in both Python (Python 3.9.16) and C++ (C++ 14).
The C++ program comprises a main file (CreateCartoon.cpp) and the two class files (CartoonEffects.h and CartoonEffects.cpp). Please note, the C++ program only generates the cartoon effect of the image. 
The Python code consists of a single file (generateEffectsSketches.py) and can generate the cartton effect as well as other sketches of the image.
